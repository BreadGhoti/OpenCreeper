# Open Creeper

## How to play

Open Creeper can be played on GitHub Pages which is here: http://alexanderzeillinger.github.com/OpenCreeper/
Of course you can download everything and play locally and offline.

## About

Open Creeper is an open source JavaScript game heavily inspired by Creeper World 3 by Knuckle Cracker which is currently in development.
I wrote this to improve my skills with JavaScript and it may also serve as an educational resource for others.
That being said it is not a full game and can not be won as no winning conditions are implemented.
Also a lot of gameplay features that you will find in CW3 are not implemented, like:

- Terraforming
- Orbitals
- Nullifier
- Disarm building
- Multiple command nodes
- Guppy
- AntiCreeper
- Saving/Loading
- Group movement
- Storyline
- Achievements
- Statistics
- Upgrades
- Titans
- Zoom

## Development

The game is not without bugs so if you are a developer feel free to contribute. If you just want to give feedback you can post an issue.

## Browser Compatibility and Performance

Please use the latest version of either Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer.
