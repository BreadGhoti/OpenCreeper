# Open Creeper

## How to play

Open Creeper can be played on GitHub Pages which is here: http://alexanderzeillinger.github.com/OpenCreeper/

## About

Open Creeper is an open source game heavily inspired by Creeper World 3 by Knuckle Cracker.
The core gameplay is the same but there are a few differences to make it a bit different.

I wrote this to improve my skills with JavaScript and it may also serve as an educational resource for others.

Update: I ported the game to Dart where it runs about twice as fast, yay! You can try the Dart version with
Dartium: http://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/

The JavaScript version is still there but coding actively progresses in the Dart version now.

If you like this kind of games I suggest you buy and play the original Creeper World games.

## Development

The game is not without bugs so if you are a developer feel free to contribute. If you just want to give feedback you can post an issue.
