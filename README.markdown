# Open Creeper

## How to play

Open Creeper can be played on GitHub Pages which is here: http://alexanderzeillinger.github.com/OpenCreeper/
Of course you can download everything and play locally and offline.

## About

Open Creeper is an open source JavaScript game heavily inspired by Creeper World 3 by Knuckle Cracker.
I wrote this to improve my skills with JavaScript and it may also serve as an educational resource for others.
That being said it is not a full game and can not be won as no winning conditions are implemented.

If you like this kind of games I suggest you buy and play the original Creeper World games.

## Development

The game is not without bugs so if you are a developer feel free to contribute. If you just want to give feedback you can post an issue.

## Browser Compatibility and Performance
